## Design Guidelines
For spacing and layout, use consistent padding based on Tailwind's spacing utilities to maintain clarity and whitespace. Suggested color schemes align with accessibility standards, leveraging a light background with dark text for contrast. Use a sans-serif font for a modern look and maintain a visual hierarchy by adjusting sizes and weights of typography according to importance. Ensure components are responsive, utilizing flexbox properties for layout adjustments on smaller screens. Focus on accessibility practices, including keyboard navigation and aria-labels when necessary.

## Styling & Behavior
Key styling options include `className` to allow for theme-specific styles. Important interactive states such as hover effects should enhance user experienceâ€”use Tailwind's transition utilities for smooth visual feedback. The component is responsive and utilizes Tailwind's utility classes for mobile-first design considerations. Ensure to avoid hardcoded styles for flexibility, allowing styles to adapt according to design tokens when possible.

## Integration Notes
No specific CSS variables are required; however, the correct configuration of Tailwind CSS by importing necessary components in `index.css` is essential. If using theming, ensure consistent utility class usage across components to avoid layout issues. This component can easily integrate into larger systems and should be wrapped in a context provider when state management or theming is implemented.

## Best Practices
Utilize the component within a structured UI to maintain clarity and alignment with other elements. Avoid excessive re-renders by ensuring props are memoized when applicable. Focus on performance by minimizing the size of props passed, especially collections of data. Testing should emphasize usability in both desktop and mobile environments. Ensure that accessibility guidelines are adhered to by testing with assistive technologies and validating the component's usability in diverse user scenarios.
